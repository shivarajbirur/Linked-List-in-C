📚 C Linked List Implementations 🚀
Welcome to the C Linked List Repository! 🎯 This repository contains implementations of Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, and Circular Linked List in C. 🖥️✨

🔗 GitHub Repository: Doubly and Circular Linked List

📌 Features
✅ Singly Linked List (SLL) ➡️ A list where each node points to the next node, forming a simple chain. 🔗
✅ Doubly Linked List (DLL) ↔️ A list where each node has references to both previous and next nodes, allowing bidirectional traversal. 🔄
✅ Circular Linked List (CLL) 🔄 A list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop. 🔁
✅ Insertion 📝 Add elements at the beginning, end, or specific positions. 🏗️
✅ Deletion ❌ Remove elements efficiently without shifting the entire list. ✂️
✅ Traversal 🔍 Navigate through the list forward or backward. 👀
✅ Easy-to-understand C Code 🏆 Well-structured and beginner-friendly implementations. 🎓


📜 singly_linked_list.c ➡️ Implements a singly linked list
📜 doubly_linked_list.c ↔️ Implements a doubly linked list
📜 circular_linked_list.c 🔄 Implements a circular linked list

📜 Linked List Diagrams
🟢 Singly Linked List (SLL)
```
[Head] -> [Node1] -> [Node2] -> [Node3] -> NULL
```

🟣 Doubly Linked List (DLL)
```
NULL <- [Head] <-> [Node1] <-> [Node2] <-> [Node3] -> NULL
```

🔵 Circular Linked List (CLL)
```
[Head] -> [Node1] -> [Node2] -> [Node3] -> [Head] (back to start)
```

📜 Operations
🟢 Singly Linked List (SLL)
🔹 Insert at beginning - Add a node at the start of the list. 🎯
🔹 Insert at end - Add a node at the end of the list. 🔚
🔹 Delete a node - Remove a node from the list. ❌
🔹 Display list - Print all elements in the list. 🖨️

🟣 Doubly Linked List (DLL)
🔹 Insert at beginning - Add a node at the start of the list. 🎯
🔹 Insert at end - Add a node at the end of the list. 🔚
🔹 Delete a node - Remove a node efficiently. ✂️
🔹 Traverse forward & backward - Move through the list in both directions. ↔️

🔵 Circular Linked List (CLL)
🔹 Insert at beginning - Add a node at the start of the circular list. 🔄
🔹 Insert at end - Add a node at the end of the circular list. 🔚
🔹 Delete a node - Remove a node while maintaining the circular structure. 🌀
🔹 Circular traversal - Keep moving through the list endlessly. 🔁
